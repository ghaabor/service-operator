# service-operator
service-operator is Kubernetes operator with a Custom Resource for easily deploying web services.

## Description
This repo exposes the `apps.ghaabor.io/v1` Kubernetes API and currently it contains one CR called `WebService`. The Go code implements the Controller and the respective Go types for `WebService` resource.

The `WebService` resource exposes a simple API:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.ghaabor.io/v1
kind: WebService
metadata:
  name: webservice-sample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  host: "demo.ghaabor.io"
  image: "nginx:latest"
```

In the background, the following Kubernetes resources are created after apply:

* `Deployment`: Using the provided `replicas` and `image`. Image can be any docker image which exposes something on the port `80`.
* `Service`: Exposes the deployment's port `80`.
* `Ingress`: A Kubernetes `Ingress` using the NGINX Ingress Controller with the hostname defined in `host`, with TLS enabled for it using `cert-manager` (see later in _Cluster prerequisites_) and it's attached to the previously created `Service` resource.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use something like [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**NOTE:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Cluster prerequisites
* [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#quick-start)
* [cert-manager installed](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubectl/)
* [letsencrypt issuer configured](https://cert-manager.io/docs/tutorials/acme/nginx-ingress/#step-6---configure-a-lets-encrypt-issuer)
* Modify your `/etc/hosts` file and add: `127.0.0.1 demo.ghaabor.io`
    * Another option is to run e.g. `curl` commands with an addition host header: `curl -H 'Host: demo.ghaabor.io' http://localhost`

**NOTE:** Deploying the operator on a remote setup requires a proper DNS configuration which is not covered in this documentation.

### Example letsencrypt issuer

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
spec:
  selfSigned: {}
```

Or [create your own CA](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/adventures-in-encryption-securing-your-laptop-kubernetes-cluster-9e032bf77f3e) and use that to generate keys:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: supersecret-ca-keypair
```

**NOTE:** When using your own CA, don't forget to import the certificate into your browser of choice!

### Running on the cluster
1. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/ghaabor/service-operator:main
```

2. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

3. Open [https://demo.ghaabor.io](https://demo.ghaabor.io)

### Undeploy controller
Remove the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
